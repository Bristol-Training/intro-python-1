## How a computer works

Imagine a computer as a highly efficient, precise worker designed to process information and execute tasks exactly as instructed.

At the heart of this system are two essential components: 

- **Central Processing Unit (CPU)** - It's primary role is to interpret and carry out instructions. It operates at remarkable speed, handling millions of instructions per second.

- **Memory (RAM)** - It is the workspace where the computer temporarily stores the information and instructions the CPU needs to access. Unlike long-term storage (like a hard drive), memory is volatile and its contents are lost when the computer is turned off.

Fundamentally, the CPU retrieves the next instruction from memory, interprets what it means and carries out the instruction â€” whether that's performing a calculation or moving data. This cycle is repeated continuously, allowing the computer to perform complex tasks by breaking them down into simple, **sequential** steps.

### Programming

A program is, in essence, an algorithm: a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or performing a task. The computer follows these instructions exactly as written, with no room for interpretation or assumption.

A programming language is a formal system of instructions used to create computer applications. In other words, it allows humans to communicate with computers by providing a way for writing instructions that can be executed by a machine.

Programming is the process of writing a precise sequence of instructions that tell the computer what to do.
