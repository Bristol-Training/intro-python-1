### Conda-Forge

#### Install Miniforge (Recommended for Conda-Forge)
Miniforge is a lightweight installer that sets up Conda with the conda-forge channel (i.e. source of libraries) as the default that provides a robust environment for data science and machine learning workflows.

Go to <https://conda-forge.org/download/> and download the latest version for your operating system.

- **Windows**: Download the [Miniforge installer for Windows](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Windows-x86_64.exe). Run the installer and follow the prompts.


- **Mac/Linux**: Download the appropriate [installer script (2021 and newer MacBooks)](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh) and and run:

  ```{.bash filename="Terminal/Command Prompt"}
  bash Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh
  ```
  Follow the on-screen instructions.

#### Verify Installation
After installation, open a command prompt/terminal and check if Conda is installed:

```{.bash  filename="Terminal/Command Prompt"}
conda --version
```


### Steps to Create and Activate an Environment

#### Create a New Environment
Open a command prompt or terminal. Use the following command to create an environment named `training` with Python 3.12, Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas and Scikit-Learn:

```{.bash filename="Terminal/Command Prompt"}
conda create -n training python=3.12 jupyterlab pandas scikit-learn
```
This installs all specified packages in one command.

If you need to install packages individually after creating an environment, use:
```{.bash filename="Terminal/Command Prompt"}
conda install [PACKAGES]
```

For example:
```{.bash filename="Terminal/Command Prompt"}
conda install jupyterlab
```

#### Activate the Environment
To activate the newly created environment type:

```{.bash filename="Terminal/Command Prompt"}
conda activate training
```

The terminal prompt will change to show `(training)` indicating the environment is active.

Last, launch Jupyter Lab typing:
```{.bash filename="Terminal/Command Prompt"}
jupyter lab
```

Jupyter Lab interface should open on your local web browser:

We're now ready to get started!
