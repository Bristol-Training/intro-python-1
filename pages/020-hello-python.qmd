title: Hello, Python!
---

This course will use a tool called *Jupyter Notebooks* to run your Python code. Once Jupyter Lab is open, to open a Notebook go to `File` > `New` > `Notebook` or click the `Python 3` button under `Notebook` section in the `Launcher` tab.

Once the notebook is launched, you will see a wide grey box with a blue `[ ]:` to the left. The grey box is an input cell where you type any Python code you want to run. For instance, type:

```{.python}
print("Hello, Python!")
```

Then, to run the cell click the button (▶) in the toolbar at the top or press Ctrl-Enter or Shift-Enter with the cursor inside. The output will appear below when the cell is run:

```{python}
print("Hello, Python!")
```

Congratulations, you’ve just written and executed your very first Python code!


Python have special integration with Jupyter Notebooks and so can display their output directly into the page. For example `pandas` will format tables of data nicely and `matplotlib` will embed graphs directly. Try copying the below code into a new cell and run it (**we don't expect you to understand it**):

```{python}
import pandas as pd
temp = pd.DataFrame(
    [3.1, 2.4, 4.8, 4.1, 3.4, 4.2],
    columns=["temp (°C)"],
    index=pd.RangeIndex(2000, 2006, name="year")
)
temp
```

```{python}
temp.plot()
```



## Commenting your code

It is **good practice** to add comments to your code so it is easy to understand by other programmers or even yourself after a few months. This is particularly important if there's anything non-obvious in your code. To add a comments you can use a `#` symbol at any position in your script, what is behind '#' will be ignored by Python when running that line of code. 

```{python}
# This script prints my favourite colour

# print("Don't print me!") 

print("My favourite colour is red") # print my favourite colour
```
