## Install Miniforge

Miniforge is a lightweight installer that sets up Conda to install packages from conda-forge, a robust environment for data science and machine learning workflows.

Go to the [conda-forge website](https://conda-forge.org/download/) and download the latest version of Miniforge for your operating system.

- **Windows**: Download the [Miniforge installer for Windows](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Windows-x86_64.exe). Run the installer and follow the prompts.

- **Mac/Linux**: Download the appropriate [installer script (2021 and newer MacBooks)](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh) and and run:

  ```{.bash filename="Terminal/Command Prompt"}
  bash Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh
  ```
  Follow the on-screen instructions.

## Verify installation

After installation, open a command prompt/terminal and check if Conda is installed:

```{.bash  filename="Terminal/Command Prompt"}
conda --version
```

## Create a new environment

Open a command prompt or terminal. Use the following command to create an environment named `training` with Python 3.12, Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas and Scikit-Learn:

```{.bash filename="Terminal/Command Prompt"}
conda create -n training python=3.12 jupyterlab pandas seaborn scikit-learn
```

This installs all specified packages in one command.

## Installing additional packages

If you need to install additional packages, use `conda install`.
For example, to install `scipy` type:

```{.bash filename="Terminal/Command Prompt"}
conda install -n training scipy
```
:::

## Activate the environment

To activate the newly created environment type:

```{.bash filename="Terminal/Command Prompt"}
conda activate training
```

The terminal prompt will change to show `(training)` indicating the environment is active.

Last, launch Jupyter Lab by typing:

```{.bash filename="Terminal/Command Prompt"}
jupyter lab
```

The Jupyter Lab interface should open on your local web browser:
