#### University-Managed Laptops

If you're using a university-managed laptop, the easiest and most recommended method is to install Anaconda through Self Service:

1. Open the Company Portal (Windows) or Self Service (Mac) application on your laptop
2. Search for "Anaconda"
3. Click on the Anaconda package and follow the installation prompts

#### Alternative Installation Method

If you don't have access to Self Service or are using a personal computer, you can download and install Anaconda directly from the web:

1. Visit the official Anaconda website (https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
2. Download the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
3. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions

Once Anaconda is installed, start "Anaconda Navigator" and press the JupyterLab button on the main screen:

This will open JupyterLab in your default web browser and will look something like this:

We're now ready to get started!
